# List of test cases we have done thourgh out the development of our project

## unit tests


## end user tests

For our end user tests we gathered a small amount of 10 people and we presented them with each our game at various steps of development.

### Test 1: The initial screen test

One of our initial designs was the intro screen. We presented three designs of intro screens with different colour pallets. Based on a majority choice by our chosen group of users we decided to implement the final choice

### Test 2: Options menu contents and layout

We constructed an Options menu layout with intially 4 different things that could be chnaged about the game. These included volume, colour, screen resoultion, and cursor image. However when we presented our end users with our design we have recieved some critical feedback. Mostly that the cursor image and colour were not nessessary. So they were removed from the options menu.
